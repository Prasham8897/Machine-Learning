The following files are included:

1. ratings.csv contains the ratings data in the format: user_id, movie_id, rating

2. ratings_test.csv contains the test set with ground truth in the same format as ratings.txt.

3. movies.txt contains the mapping from movie_id to movie name. Row j corresponds to index j of movie_id.

4. README (original) is the original readme for the MovieLens 100K data set

Comment: I have subtracted the mean from the ratings. No other pre-processing is necessary.
